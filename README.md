# SignalGeneratorClass

A simple sin wave generator for creating test signals. The goal of the project is to have the ability to generate signals quickly that can be be used to test analysis methods and software utilities. 


Moving forward, we would like to add signal generators that simulate signals present in the polysonomogram (sleep study).  We are particularly interested in adding realistic electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephlogram (EEG). Please contact us if you are interested in extending the generator to include these signals.
